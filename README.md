**USAGE**

**Download SNI IP Ranges**

To download the latest SNI IP ranges from providers such as ***Amazon, DigitalOcean, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle***, run the following command:

```./sni_lookup.sh -update```

This will create or update the `sni-ranges` folder with individual files for each provider.

**Search Domain in SNI IP Ranges**

To search for a specific domain within the downloaded SNI IP ranges, use the following command:

```./sni_lookup.sh <domain>```

Replace `<domain>` with the domain you want to search for. The script will display matches for the specified domain within each provider's IP range file.

**Example**

```./sni_lookup.sh example.com```
